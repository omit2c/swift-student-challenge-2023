# swift-student-challenge-2023
My Swift project for the Swift Student Challenge 2023

## The idea

I wanted to create something that can really help others and is actually usefull rather than a project nobody finds a use for. So I came up with the idea of a team manager as this was something I thought, would be useful.

## The technologies used

For my app I used (as it was the challenge) I used Swift Playgrounds for iPad with SwiftUI. To save data I used Core Data and designed the app with the SwiftUI framework.
